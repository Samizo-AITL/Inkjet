# Inkjet Technology Archive

This repository is a structured, educational archive based **only on publicly available information**  
related to inkjet printhead technologies.

It provides systematic comparisons and classifications of printhead technologies from leading companies  
such as **EPSON, Canon, Ricoh, Fujifilm, and HP**, covering:

- Structural principles and drive mechanisms  
- Ink compatibility and usage domains  
- Drop ejection evaluation methods  
- Applications in 3D printing

## 🔓 Open Access Policy

- This repository is constructed from **public-domain technical information**, academic papers, patents, and online publications.
- Detailed proprietary data such as product blueprints, cross-sectional diagrams, or manufacturing specifications—especially regarding EPSON—are **maintained in a separate private repository**: `Private/Epson/`
- By strictly separating open vs. confidential domains, this archive is designed to be a safe base for education, research, and fair technology comparisons.
